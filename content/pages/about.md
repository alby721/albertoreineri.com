## Short bio
<img style="float: left; height:300px;padding-right:15px;padding-top:10px" src="/media/me2.jpeg">

***I was born way back in 1991....*** Oh no, that's the long story! Let's cut it off.

I'm a huge fan of technology, since the ADSL connection arrived in my little town at the **bottom of the Alps**, in the north west of Italy.

I started developing after the high school, working for a company that uses **VB.Net and ASP**. After four years
i decided to follow the other passion of my life: **theology**.
In 2014 I started studying religious sciences and I graduated in 2018. I teached in italan school at every level, from the child to the high school and i liked it so much.

During my teaching period i started having health problem, so i had to quit my job.

While i was ill at home i **restarted coding** and loving it so much. Month after month i relearned the basic of development and i'm specialized in core php and WordPress development from scratch (I know that I don't have to reinvent the wheel, but i like it).

Now I'm a **Freelance Web Developer**, I create website for my clients, I develop projects that i like, doing some open source and write lots of articles about programming life.

I decided to start ad English blog for **improve my english skills** (if you find some errors please report them) and start to create somethings in **modern Javascript** (it isn't used much where i'm from...)

***Hope you like that projects!***
