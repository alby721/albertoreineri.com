After developing several websites in WordPress __I created a starter theme__ with the features that I consider essential to start a new project.

I decided to open source this basic theme, which I called "Orange Starter Theme". __I strongly believe in open source__ and try to participate as often as possible.

The theme __can be downloaded on my GitHub profile__: [https://github.com/alby721/Orange-Starter-Theme](https://github.com/alby721/Orange-Starter-Theme)

Using it is __very simple__, the home page contains the docs in italian. 
You just have to download it and edit as you like.

The theme includes __Bootstrap, Font Awesome and a custom JS script for "go to top" button__, in addition to the basic WordPress features (archives, comments, search, etc.)

From this base you can create a custom theme __quickly__, without wasting time configuring the initial parameters, including styles etc ...

For any __questions__, do not hesitate to __contact me to [info@albertoreineri.it](mailto:info@albertoreineri.it)__
